# landing-page

This project is from The Odin Project where I had to build a same looking landing page using everything I had learnt i.e. HTML, CSS (including flexbox), which we could personalize to our tastes if we want. We had been given <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png">this</a> to copy.

Through this project, I demonstrate my skills in-
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. CSS Flexbox
4. Version Control
